# e4040-2021Spring-project

## This README file should be modified by students when submitting their project, so that it contains a detailed description of the project, as well as the directory/file tree.

# Teams of up to 3 students (see notes about naming below)

# Seed repo for projects for this semester
  - distributed as Github Repo and shared via Github Classroom
  - contains only README.md file
  - Students must have at least one main Jupyter Notebook, a number of python files in a number of directories and subdirectories such as utils or similar, as demonstrated in the assignments during the semester
  - The organization of the directories has to be meaningful

# Detailed instructions how to submit this assignment/homework/project:
1. The assignment will be distributed as a github classroom assignment - as a special repository accessed through a link
2. A students copy of the assignment gets created automatically with a special name - students have to rename the repo per instructions below
3. The solution(s) to the assignment have to be submitted inside that repository as a set of "solved" Jupyter Notebooks, and several modified python files which reside in directories/subdirectories
4. Three files/screenshots need to be uploaded into the directory "figures" which prove that the assignment has been done in the cloud

## (Re)naming of a project repository shared by multiple students (TODO students)
INSTRUCTIONS for naming the students' solution repository for assignments with more students, such as the final project. Students need to use a 4-letter groupID): 
* Template: e4040-2021Spring-Project-GroupID-UNI1-UNI2-UNI3. -> Example: e4040-2021Spring-Project-MEME-zz9999-aa9999-aa0000.

# Organization of this directory
To be populated by students, as shown in previous assignments
The directory tree needs to be shown below
